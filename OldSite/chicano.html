<p><font size=6><b><i>Are Chicana/os the same as Mexicans?</font>
<p><font size=4>
Here is a "taxonomy" that may be a useful reference for this topic: 
<p><font size=5 color=white>"Spanish people"</font>
<p>This term is used frequently in the United States to refer
indiscriminately to any person that speaks Spanish. As
such, it is imprecise and often inappropriate in that it includes people
from more than two dozen countries, spanning
all of the American continent, the Caribbean and Spain. The term does
apply specifically, however, as the proper
name for the native people of Spain, and for this reason it is as
incorrect to use it to refer to any and all
Spanish-speakers as the term "English" would be to refer to citizens of
New Zealand, Australia or the United States.

<p><font size=5 color=white>Hispanics</font>
<p> 
This term is often used to refer collectively to all Spanish-speakers.
However, it specifically connotes a lineage or
cultural heritage related to Spain. As many millions of people who speak
Spanish are not of true Spanish descent
(e.g., native Americans), and millions more live in Latin America (cf.,
"Latino" below) yet do not speak Spanish or
claim Spanish heritage (e.g., Brazilians) this term is incorrect as a
collective name for all Spanish-speakers, and
may actually be cause for offense. 

<p><font size=5 color=white>Latina/o</font>
<p>This term is used to refer to people originating from, or having a
heritage related to, Latin America, in recognition of
the fact that this set of people is actually a superset of many
nationalities. Since the term "Latin" comes into use as
the least common denominator for all peoples of Latin America in
recognition of the fact that some romance
language (Spanish, Portuguese, French) is the native tongue of the
majority of Latin Americans, this term is widely
accepted by most. However, the term is not appropriate for the millions of
native Americans who inhabit the region.

<p><font size=5 color=white>Mexican</font>
<p>Specifically, the nationality of the inhabitants of Mexico. Therefore,
the
term is used appropriately for Mexican
citizens who visit or work in the United States, but it is insufficient to
designate those people who are citizens of the
United States (they were born in the US or are naturalized citizens of the
US) who are of Mexican ancestry. The
various terms used to properly designate such people are described below,
however, it is important to explain why
these people feel it is important to make such a distinction. US citizens
who are troubled by this often point out that
most immigrants do not distinguish themselves by point of origin first,
(i.e., German-American), but simply as
"Americans" (another troublesome term, but we won't get detoured by that
here). Here are some reasons why many
US citizens of Mexican extraction feel that it is important to make the
distinction:

<p><font size=5 color=white>*Not "Americans" by choice</font>
<p>A scant 150 years ago, approximately 50% of what was then Mexico was
appropriated by the US as spoils of war,
and in a series of land "sales" that were coerced capitalizing on the US
victory in that war and Mexico's weak
political and economic status. A sizable number of Mexican citizens became
citizens of the United States from one
day to the next as a result, and the treaty declaring the peace between
the two countries recognized the rights of such
people to their private properties (as deeded by Mexican or Spanish
colonial authorities), their own religion (Roman
Catholicism) and the right to speak and receive education in their own
tongue (for the majority, Spanish) [refer to
the text of the treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo]. Therefore, the descendants
of this population continue to press for
such rights, and many hold that theirs is a colonized land and people in
view of the fact that their territory and
population was taken over by military force.

<p><font size=5 color=white>*Mexicans first, "Americans" second?</font>
<p>Another and more numerous class of US citizens of Mexican extraction
are
either descendants of, or are themselves,
people who conceive of themselves as temporarily displaced from Mexico by
economic circumstances. As opposed
to the waves of European migrants who willingly left their countries due
to class and religious discrimination, and
sought to make their lives anew in the "new world" and never to return to
the "old land," these displaced Mexicans
typically maintain strong family ties in Mexico (by visiting periodically,
and by investing their incomes in homes or
kin in Mexico), and usually intend to return to Mexico provided they can
become economically secure. Therefore
these people maintain and nurture their children in their language,
religion and customs.
<p>
However, There is great tension within this population between those of
Mexican birth who conceive of themselves
as temporary guests in the US, and their descendants who are born in the
US, are acculturated with the norms of
broader US society in public schools, and are not motivated by the same
ties that bind a migrant generation of
Mexicans. This creates a classic "niche" of descendants of immigrants who
are full-fledged US citizens, but who
typically do not have access to all the rights and privileges of
citizenship because of the strong cultural identity
imbued in them by their upbringing and the discriminatory reaction of the
majority population against a
non-assimilated and easily identified subclass. This group of people feels
a great need to distinguish itself from both
its US milieu and its Mexican "Mother Culture," which does not typically
welcome or accept "prodigals." This is
truly a unique set of people, therefore, in that it endures both strong
ties and strong discrimination from both US
and Mexican mainstream parent cultures. The result has been the creation
of a remarkable new culture that needs its
own name and identity.

<p><font size=5 color=white>Mexican-American</font>
<p>This term is commonly used to recognize US citizens who are descendants
of
Mexicans, following the pattern
sometimes used to identify the extraction of other ethnic Americans (e.g.,
"African-American). This term is
acceptable to many Mexican descendants, but for those who do not identify
with a Mexican heritage, but rather with
a Spanish heritage, it is unacceptable (cf., "Hispano," below). Also, for
those who do not view themselves as
"Americans" by choice, this term is problematic, and for others the
implication that the identity of the bearer is
unresolved, or in limbo, between two antipodal influences, belies their
self-concept as a blend that supersedes its
origins and is stronger, richer and more dynamic than either of its
cultural roots.

<p><font size=5 color=white>Hispana/o</font>
<p>This term is preferred by that subpopulation, located primarily in the
US southwest, who identify with the Spanish
settlers of the area, and not with the Mexican settlers (specifically, the
Creole Spanish-Native American race). There
is in fact an important number of these people located along the Rio
Grande Valley of New Mexico and in the
northern Sangre de Cristo mountain range of the same state. This group has
been traditionally a very closed and
conservative one, and recent evidence provides important explanations for
this: they seem to be descendants of
persecuted Jews who fled Spain during the 16th and 17th centuries and
sought refuge in what were then the farthest
reaches of the known world. They survived by minimizing their contact with
outsiders and by hiding or disguising
their religious and cultural identities as much as possible. Historical
researchers call them "cryptic Jews."

<p><font size=5 color=white>Chicana/o</font> 
<p>A relatively recent term that has been appropriated by many Mexican
descendants as unique and therefore reflective
of their unique culture, though its first usage seems to have been
discriminatory. The most likely source of the word
is traced to the 1930 and 40s period, when poor, rural Mexicans, often
native Americans, were imported to the US
to provide cheap field labor, under an agreement of the governments of
both countries. The term seems to have
come into first use in the fields of California in derision of the
inability of native Nahuatl speakers from Morelos
state to refer to themselves as "Mexicana/os," and instead spoke of
themselves as "Mesheecana/os," in accordance with
the pronunciation rules of their language. An equivocal factor is that in vulgar Spanish it is common
for Mexicans to use the "CH" conjunction
in place of certain consonants in order to create a term of endearment.
Whatever its origin, it was at first insulting to
be identified by this name. The term was appropriated by Mexican-American
activists who took part in the Brown
Power movement of the 60s and 70s in the US southwest, and has now come
into widespread usage. Among more
"assimilated" Mexican-Americans, the term still retains an unsavory
connotation, particularly because it is preferred
by political activists and by those who seek to create a new and fresh
identity for their culture rather than to subsume
it blandly under the guise of any mainstream culture.</p>
